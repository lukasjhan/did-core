  <dt><dfn>decentralized identity management</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">Identity
      management</a> that is based on the use of <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
    Decentralized identity management extends authority for identifier generation,
    registration, and assignment beyond traditional roots of trust such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500 directory services</a>,
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a>,

  <dd>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public key
      infrastructure</a> that does not rely on traditional <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate
      authorities</a> because it uses <a>decentralized identifiers</a> and <a>DID

  <dt><dfn data-lt="did controllers|did controller(s)|DID 컨트롤러">DID controller</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    An entity that has the capability to make changes to a <a>DID document</a>. A
    <a>DID</a> might have more than one DID controller. The DID controller(s)
    can be denoted by the optional `controller` property at the top level of the
    <a>DID document</a>. Note that a DID controller might be the <a>DID
      subject</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>DID delegate</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    An entity to whom a <a>DID controller</a> has granted permission to use a
    <a>verification method</a> associated with a <a>DID</a> via a <a>DID
      document</a>. For example, a parent who controls a child's <a>DID document</a>
    might permit the child to use their personal device in order to
    <a>authenticate</a>. In this case, the child is the <a>DID delegate</a>. The
    child's personal device would contain the private cryptographic material
    enabling the child to <a>authenticate</a> using the <a>DID</a>. However, the child
    might not be permitted to add other personal devices without the parent's
    permission.

  <dd>
    A set of data describing the <a>DID subject</a>, including mechanisms, such as
    cryptographic public keys, that the <a>DID subject</a> or a <a>DID delegate</a>
    can use to <a>authenticate</a> itself and prove its association with the
    <a>DID</a>. A DID document might have one or more different
    <a>representations</a> as defined in <a href="#representations"></a> or in the

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID queries">DID query</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    The portion of a <a>DID URL</a> that follows and includes the first question
    mark character (<code>?</code>). DID query syntax is identical to URI query
    syntax. See <a href="#query"></a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>DID resolution</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    The process that takes as its input a <a>DID</a> and a set of resolution
    options and returns a <a>DID document</a> in a conforming <a>representation</a>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID resolvers|DID 변환기">DID 변환기(DID resolver)</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A <a>DID resolver</a> is a software and/or hardware component that performs the
    <a>DID resolution</a> function by taking a <a>DID</a> as input and producing a
    conforming <a>DID document</a> as output.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID schemes|DID method scheme|DID 체계">DID 체계(DID scheme)</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    The formal syntax of a <a>decentralized identifier</a>. The generic DID scheme
    begins with the prefix <code>did:</code> as defined in <a href="#did-syntax"></a>. Each <a>DID method</a>
    specification defines a specific
    DID method scheme that works with that specific <a>DID method</a>. In a specific DID
    method scheme, the DID method name follows the first colon and terminates with
    the second colon, e.g., <code>did:example:</code>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID subjects|DID 주체">DID subject</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    The entity identified by a <a>DID</a> and described by a <a>DID document</a>.

    digital thing, logical thing, etc.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID URLs">DID URL</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A <a>DID</a> plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to the
    definition in <a href="#did-url-syntax"></a>. This includes an optional <a>DID
      path</a> (with its leading <code>/</code> character), optional <a>DID query</a>
    (with its leading <code>?</code> character), and optional <a>DID fragment</a>
    (with its leading <code>#</code> character).
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>DID URL dereferencing</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    The process that takes as its input a <a>DID URL</a> and a set of input
    metadata, and returns a <a>resource</a>. This resource might be a <a>DID
      document</a> plus additional metadata, a secondary resource
    contained within the <a>DID document</a>, or a resource entirely
    external to the <a>DID document</a>. The process uses <a>DID resolution</a> to
    fetch a <a>DID document</a> indicated by the <a>DID</a> contained within the
    <a>DID URL</a>. The dereferencing process can then perform additional processing
    on the <a>DID document</a> to return the dereferenced resource indicated by the
    <a>DID URL</a>. The inputs and outputs of this process are defined in
    <a href="#did-url-dereferencing"></a>.

    function for a given <a>DID URL</a> or <a>DID document</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="distributed ledger|distributed ledgers|distributed ledger technology|DLT|분산 원장">분산 원장(distributed
      ledger)</dfn> (DLT)
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
    sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
    to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
    different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
    cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
    transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
    immutable.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>public key description</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A data object contained inside a <a>DID document</a> that contains all the
    metadata necessary to use a public key or a verification key.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="resources">resource</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    As defined by [[RFC3986]]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
    for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
    as a <a>DID subject</a> identified by a <a>DID</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="representations">representation</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    As defined for HTTP by [[RFC7231]]: "information that is intended to reflect a
    past, current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be
    readily communicated via the protocol, and that consists of a set of
    representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of representation
    data." A <a>DID document</a> is a representation of information describing a
    <a>DID subject</a>. See <a href="#representations"></a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="representation-specific entry|non-representation-specific
entry">representation-specific entries</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    Entries in a <a>DID document</a> whose meaning is particular to a specific
    <a>representation</a>. Defined in <a href="#data-model"></a> and
    <a href="#representations"></a>. For example, <a><code>@context</code></a> in
    the <a href="#json-ld">JSON-LD representation</a> is a
    <em>representation-specific entry</em>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="service|서비스">services</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Means of communicating or interacting with the <a>DID subject</a> or
    associated entities via one or more <a>service endpoints</a>.
    Examples include discovery services, agent services, social networking
    services, file storage services, and verifiable credential repository services.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="service endpoints">service endpoint</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A network address, such as an HTTP URL, at which <a>services</a> operate on
    behalf of a <a>DID subject</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="URI|URIs">Uniform Resource Identifier</dfn> (URI)</dt>

  <dd>
    The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
    defined by [[RFC3986]]. A <a>DID</a> is a type of URI scheme.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable
    digital credentials as defined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification
    [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <dfn data-lt="verifiable data registry|verifiable data registries">
      verifiable data registry</dfn>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and/or
    deactivation of <a>decentralized identifiers</a> and <a>DID documents</a>. A
    verifiable data registry might also be used for other
    cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as <a>verifiable
      credentials</a>. For more information, see the W3C Verifiable Credentials
    specification [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>verifiable timestamp</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    A verifiable timestamp enables a third-party to verify that a data object
    existed at a specific moment in time and that it has not been modified or
    corrupted since that moment in time. If the data integrity could reasonably have
    been modified or corrupted since that moment in time, the timestamp is not
    verifiable.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="verification method|검증 방법">검증 방법(verification method)</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>
      A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
      verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
      verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
      verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
      example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
      exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
      integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
      method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
      "verification" or "proof."
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification relationship</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>
      An expression of the relationship between the <a>DID subject</a> and a
      <a>verification method</a>. An example of a verification relationship is
      <a href="#authentication"></a>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="UUID|UUIDs">Universally Unique Identifier</dfn> (UUID)</dt>

  <dd>
    A type of globally unique identifier defined by [[RFC4122]]. UUIDs are similar
    to DIDs in that they do not require a centralized registration authority. UUIDs
    differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
    cryptographically-verifiable.
  </dd>
